# TtR Companion

A fun littke companion app for the hit board-game 'Ticket to Ride'

It's not perfect, by any means, but it (should) do what it's designed to do.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is not done!

## Getting Started

Right now, this app is not available on any platform, as it is still in development

To run the app in the ios simulator, for example, simply clone the repository, and run with flutter!

```bash
git clone [TODO: add repo url here]
cd flutter_to_ride
flutter run
```
